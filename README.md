# MS365
During the 2023-2024 school year, I taught **MS 365 - Information Technology II - Business Analytics** at Butler University. The class taught students how to use the python language to do data analysis. These are some of the more challenging homework assignments that were assigned.

**Everything was written by me, not AI**
